# Daily Divide — daily generation instructions

This repo publishes a daily page that takes **one contested political issue** and scores it
on a left–right meter — not by which side's *values* are right, but by how well each side's
*checkable claims and reasoning* hold up. The page is static; the only thing that changes
each day is one JSON data file. **Your job, on the daily schedule, is to research the day's
most-argued political issue and produce that file.**

## What to do each run

1. **Determine today's date** (UTC) → `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. **Pick the issue.** Use web search to find the political topic that is *genuinely the
   most argued about* today — US or international, chosen on the merits (see `SCORING.md` →
   "Topic selection"). Favor issues with a real factual core.
3. **Research both sides.** Read a **broad, ideologically diverse** set of sources:
   - left-leaning and right-leaning outlets *and* wire services / nonpartisan reporting;
   - primary sources where possible (bills, rulings, official data, transcripts).
   Find how each side **frames** the issue and the **checkable claims** each one leans on.
4. **Verify every claim to the highest degree.** Follow the verification protocol in
   `SCORING.md` for each fact: actually **open the source** (don't trust search snippets);
   **go to primary documents first** (statute/bill text on Congress.gov & the U.S. Code,
   roll-call records, rulings, official data, hearing transcripts, the actual letter/press
   release) and use reporting only to corroborate; quote the confirming figure/wording in
   `evidence`; **corroborate contested claims across the political spectrum** — a
   right-trusted *and* a left-trusted outlet, plus a neutral wire/reference — not just within
   one tribe; cite the source that truly contains the figure; and set `confidence` honestly.
   Mark party-to-conflict figures lower, surface source conflicts or staleness, and if a page
   can't be fetched (incl. government 403s), say so and downgrade confidence. No quotable
   receipt → `unverifiable` or drop the claim. Never fabricate a quote, figure, or URL.
5. **Run the power test (the longer view).** Ask whether each side would hold its position if
   the other party held power, find the role-reversed historical precedent, and document
   concrete position-flips on **both** sides — see `SCORING.md` → "The longer view." Record
   it in `powerLens`. Selective constitutional conviction is a `reasoningHonesty` penalty,
   not a needle mover.
6. **Score strictly against `SCORING.md`:**
   - two sub-scores per side (`factualAccuracy`, `reasoningHonesty`) → blended `score`;
   - `needle = right.score − left.score`, clamped −100…+100 (rests on present-tense facts);
   - 5–9 graded `facts` (with `confidence`, `evidence`, `corroboration`), covering **both** sides;
   - a `powerLens` (thesis, precedent, two-sided `flips`, `longRun`, `appliedToScore`);
   - 3–5 `notAdjudicable` value questions;
   - one `biasWatch` paragraph with a concrete "tell";
   - a short `verificationNote` describing how the day's claims were checked.
7. **Write** `data/YYYY-MM-DD.json` following the schema of the most recent file in `data/`.
8. **Update** `data/manifest.json`: add today's date to the **front** of `days`, set
   `updated` to today.
9. **Commit and push** to `main` with a message like
   `Daily Divide: YYYY-MM-DD — <topic> (needle NN)`. The push redeploys GitHub Pages.

## Rules

- One file per day. **Never edit or re-score past days** — the archive is immutable.
- Every `facts` entry must cite a real story or primary source. No invented claims/URLs.
- **Score the same way whichever side wins.** Separate facts from values religiously: if you
  dislike what a side *wants*, that belongs in `notAdjudicable`, never in the meter.
- Most honest days land in the modest middle of the meter. A drift toward one pole over many
  days, or a pile-up at the extremes, means *your* bias has crept in — recalibrate.
- Keep `summary` and `verdict` measured: say what the evidence shows and what it can't settle.
- Do not change `index.html`, `app.js`, or `style.css` during a daily run unless explicitly
  asked; daily runs are data-only.

## How this is scheduled

A **Claude Code on the web scheduled session** (daily trigger) runs this folder with the
prompt in `.claude/daily-prompt.md`. The schedule is configured in the web UI — see
`SETUP.md`. Pushing the new data file triggers GitHub Pages to redeploy the page.

## Layout

- `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css` — the static page (renders from JSON).
- `data/<date>.json` — one immutable day per file.
- `data/manifest.json` — index of available days + last-updated.
- `SCORING.md` — the fixed rubric. **Read it every run.**
- `SETUP.md` — how to deploy (GitHub Pages) and schedule the daily session.
